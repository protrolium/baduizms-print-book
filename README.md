# Baduizm(s) • a visual album

## Print Layout by gavcloud & Estevan Carlos Benson

Description: Part videographic love letter, part psychedelic tour diary, part alien transmission intercepting the branchial graph of the multitude's vectorized awareness of the being also known as Erykah Badu, gavcloud weaves together a bricolage of moments captured during his time on the road with Neda Stella, Badu's band and touring entourage. As a video artist and designer of the live show during the 2010s, gavcloud's visual album that accompanies his remix project Baduizm(s) not only hyper-reassembles the sonics from Badu's debut album, but refactors the amalgamated visual melee of the «Queen of Clubs» live show ethos and bravura, crystalizing in a snapshot of the two artists' creative collaboration.
